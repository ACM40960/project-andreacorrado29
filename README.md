## Abstract
Within this project, we explore and model the global temperature and rain over the last century with a system of ODE. Moreover, we keep track of different waterbirds species individual counts in South Africa over time. 
The interest of the project is to understand what the relation between the global climate change and the animal species count. We make use of the data available to train different models and validate them by specific diagnostic tools.
Once the diffent models validation, we want to make prediction up to a certain level of uncertainty. By making prediction for future years, we want to understand whether and when these species will extinguish.
